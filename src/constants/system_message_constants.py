#This module defines the system messages that are used when making calls to \
#the OpenAI API.
#These messages are used as prompts for the AI to generate responses. They \
#include instructions for the AI on what it should do, such as translating a \
#message, detecting a language, categorizing a request, or formulating a \
#response.
#Each constant in this module is a string that contains the system message.
