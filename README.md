# Customer Service Bot

This project aims to implement a customer service bot powered by OpenAI's language model. The bot is designed to process customer requests, categorize them into predefined categories, and generate appropriate responses.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the project.
  - `main.py`: The main script that coordinates the processing of customer requests.
  - `system_message_constants.py`: Contains system messages used by the language model.
  - `utils/`: Contains utility scripts that provide various functionalities:
    - `api.py`: Provides a function to call OpenAI's language model.
    - `categorize.py`: Provides a function to categorize customer requests.
    - `respond.py`: Provides a function to generate responses to customer requests.
    - `translate.py`: Provides a function to translate customer requests.
    - `load_data.py`: Provides a function to load data from files.
    - `save_data.py`: Provides a function to save data to files.
- `data/`: Contains data used by the project.
  - `inputs/customer_requests/`: Contains customer request files.
  - `outputs/`: Contains output files generated by the bot.
  - `contexts/`: Contains context files used for generating responses.
- `tests/`: Contains test scripts for the project (if any).
- `docs/`: Contains documentation for the project (if any).

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up your OpenAI API key in a `.env` file in the root directory of the project: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key`

## Usage

To process all customer requests in the `data/inputs/customer_requests/` directory and generate responses, run the following command:

```bash
python src/main.py
