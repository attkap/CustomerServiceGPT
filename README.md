# Customer Service Chatbot

This project implements a customer service chatbot powered by OpenAI's language model. The chatbot processes customer requests, categorizes them into predefined categories, translates them into English, generates appropriate responses, and checks the response for harm and correctness.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the project.
  - `main.py`: The main script that coordinates the processing of customer requests.
  - `utils/`: Contains utility scripts that provide various functionalities:
    - `api/api.py`: Contains the configuration for the OpenAI API key.
    - `request_handlers/`: Contains scripts to handle requests, including translation, categorization, response formulation, and response checking.
    - `data_processing/`: Contains scripts for processing data and logging information.
- `data/`: Contains data used by the project.
  - `customer_requests/`: Contains customer request files.
  - `LLM_outputs/`: Contains output files generated by the bot.
  - `category_contexts/`: Contains context files used for generating responses.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Add your OpenAI API key to the `api.py` file, located in `src/utils/api`.
